# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection
<br> It is common noawadays that people are only aware of having cancer only when they are already in stage 3 or 4, which could be too late to start treatment.
Hence our team wanted to come up with a solution **to detect cancer with computer vision models with high accuracy** . Due to the low cost and fast prediction, it maybe can use like a **reference before actual cancer test** at the hospital. It can make people **more aware** of **early medical examination** and **not hesitate** because it is **much more cheaper** than actual one</br>

Data set that I use was to large to submit, I have attached the train_label.csv and word file contain links
<br>Link of the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data) that we have used</br>
